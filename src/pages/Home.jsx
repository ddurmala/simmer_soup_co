            <p className="about p-4">
                Simmer soup company was created out of the frustration of finding a decent homemade soup. All of our soups are made in small batches, from scratch,using the best possible ingredients, including pasture-raised meats, and organic vegetables as well as scratch-made soup bases and broths. There’s not a single artificial ingredient in them. Our soups are a nutritious quick meal, and you can taste all the love that went into making each one! Right now we’re offering pre-order quart size only. Pick ups will be Sunday mornings.
